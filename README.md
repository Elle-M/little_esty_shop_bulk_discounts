In week 5 of Mod 2 the final solo project assignment is a multiday solo project named Little Esty Shop Bulk Discounts. Listed below are our specifications and outcomes of the project. 

## Learning Goals

* Write migrations to create tables and relationships between tables.
* Implement CRUD functionality for a resource using forms (form_tag or form_with), buttons, and links.
* Use MVC to organize code effectively, limiting the amount of logic included in views and controllers.
* Use built-in ActiveRecord methods to join multiple tables of data, make calculations, and group data based on one or more attributes.
* Write model tests that fully cover the data logic of the application.
* Write feature tests that fully cover the functionality of the application.

## About

This project is an extension of the Little Esty Shop group project. I added functionality for merchants to create bulk discounts for their items. A “bulk discount” is a discount based on the quantity of items the customer is buying, for example “20% off orders of 10 or more items”.

## Built With

Ruby v2.7.4 and Rails 5.2.8, RSpec 3.12 versions, PostgreSQL.

## Testing

A key goal of this project is to utilize Test Driven Development for models and features, and the SimpleCov gem to determine percentage of test coverage.
